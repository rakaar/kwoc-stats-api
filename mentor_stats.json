To display report in Tkinter GUI, used FigureCanvasTkAgg to add the piechart figure as a widget to the frame.\r\n2. A try-except block is added to delete (if any) previous figures in order to display the new report. Previously, the multiple reports were being displayed on the same frame as and when the user wishes to see them. Thus, after displaying three reports there was no space to display more. Hence , I decided to overwrite the reports in case of multiple report requests.\r\n3. The statement self.root.after(...) is moved inside the if self.recording loop. This is done because when the recording stops, the statement shouldn't be executed. If it continues to execute in 'stop' condition, and the user decides to start the recording again, we see to separate self.root.after(...) loops running simultaneously.
